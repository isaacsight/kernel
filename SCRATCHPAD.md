## Current Session (2026-04-13) — AI NEWS UPDATES branch

Branch: `claude/ai-news-updates-y2qoY`

**Shipped:**
- `packages/kbot/src/news.ts` — new module. Pulls from HN (algolia), arXiv (Atom feed, inline parse), GitHub trending (public search). Optional local-Ollama `--summarize` via `/api/generate`.
- `packages/kbot/src/cli.ts` — new `kbot news` subcommand with `--source`, `--limit`, `--summarize`, `--model`, `--json` flags. Wired right after `kbot briefing` registration.
- `packages/kbot/src/auth.ts` — PROVIDERS updated for April 2026 news cycle:
  - anthropic.models += `claude-mythos-5` (10T params, restricted preview — falls through to sonnet if key not allow-listed)
  - openai.models += `gpt-5.4-thinking` (autonomous-agent variant, 75% desktop benchmarks)
  - google.models += `gemini-3.1-pro`, `gemini-3.1` (real-time voice + image; 6x memory compression)
  - openrouter.models += mirrored entries for the above
- `tools/kbot-discovery-daemon.ts` — new `model-releases` task (6h cadence, same as intel). Scans HN + a curated GitHub org list (openai, anthropics, meta-llama, deepseek-ai, mistralai, google-deepmind, QwenLM) for release events. Writes `.kbot-discovery/model-releases/signals.jsonl` and `seen.json` (bounded to last 500 URLs). Notifies Discord on HN ≥ 100 pts.
- `KBOT_KERNEL_CHAT.md` — new operator's reference explaining how kbot CLI and the kernel.chat web companion relate, where to build features, and how to ship changes that span both.
- `CLAUDE.md` §XII — recent-changes entry for v3.74.0 (news + provider refresh).

**Not shipped (scoped out of this branch — would need separate PRs):**
- Autonomous desktop agent mode (`kbot --autonomous`) — touches computer-use safety model
- Mythos-powered security daemon task — blocked on Mythos API access
- NotebookLM-style ingest — large feature, deserves own branch
- Gemini 3.1 voice bridge — needs Gemini voice API spec
- Model cost router in `learned-router.ts` — own branch

**Next session:** verify `kbot news` end-to-end on a live network (typecheck passed, runtime not exercised here). If news output looks good, bump version in `packages/kbot/package.json` and publish.

## Previous Session (2026-04-02 afternoon) — HTTPS FIX + USER SUPPORT + MARKETING PUSH

### User Issue: Harrison (hwmccormick123@gmail.com)
- Harrison couldn't connect kbot to Claude Cowork — form requires `https://`, kbot serve only spoke HTTP
- Fixed by adding native HTTPS support to `kbot serve`
- Emailed him the fix via kernel-comms MCP
- Email agent is live and running (launchd `com.kernel.email-agent`) — Harrison can reply and get AI responses via local Ollama

### Shipped: `kbot serve --https`
- **serve.ts** — Added `--https` flag with auto-generated self-signed TLS cert (`~/.kbot/certs/`)
- **cli.ts** — Added `--https`, `--cert <path>`, `--key <path>` flags
- `ensureSelfSignedCert()` — EC P-256 cert via openssl, 365-day validity, localhost + 127.0.0.1 SANs
- Users can also provide custom certs: `kbot serve --cert x.pem --key x.key`
- Clean build, clean typecheck

## Previous Session (2026-04-01 overnight) — CLAUDE CODE LEAK → DREAM ENGINE → NIGHT SHIFT

### Claude Code Source Leak Study + Original Builds

**What happened:** Claude Code's full source (~512K lines TypeScript) leaked via source maps in npm package @anthropic-ai/claude-code@2.1.88. Studied the architecture, built original features inspired by patterns found.

### Shipped: v3.63.0 — Dream Engine + Rival Intel
- **Dream Engine** (dream.ts, 660 lines) — post-session memory consolidation via local Ollama, exponential decay aging, dream journal auto-injected into system prompt
- **5 dream tools** — dream_now, dream_status, dream_journal, dream_search, dream_reinforce
- **Rival Intel Agent** (.claude/agents/rival-intel.md) — competitive intelligence on Claude Code architecture
- **CLI** — `kbot dream run/status/search/journal`
- Published npm + pushed GitHub

### Shipped: v3.64.0 — Night Shift (buddy, voice, scanner)
- **Buddy System** (buddy.ts, 513 lines) — 8 ASCII companion species, 5 moods, deterministic assignment, persistent naming
- **Voice Input** (voice-input.ts, 466 lines) — local STT via whisper.cpp + Ollama, push-to-talk
- **Memory Scanner** (memory-scanner.ts, 564 lines) — passive in-session detection of corrections, preferences, project facts. Hooks into addTurn(), scans every 5 turns.
- **6 new tools** — buddy_status, buddy_rename, voice_listen, voice_status, memory_scan_status, memory_scan_toggle
- Published npm + pushed GitHub

### Stats
- **686 registered tools** (was 671 at session start)
- **v3.64.0** on npm (was v3.62.0 at session start)
- npm: 4,806 downloads/week, 6 GitHub stars

## Previous Session (2026-03-31 night) — ABLETON BEAT SESSION: Kalan.FrFr x Don Toliver

### Built a full beat in Ableton Live 12 via kbot OSC + AppleScript automation

#### Session: 142 BPM | F minor | Fm - Db - Ab - Eb progression

**Active tracks (all Roland Cloud):**
1. **TR-808 DRUMS** (track 5) — 81-note pattern: bouncy syncopated kick, clap on 2&4, hi-hats w/ triplet rolls, rimshot, conga
2. **ZENOLOGY 808 BASS** (track 17) — 10-note sub bass pattern, F1→Db2→Ab1→Eb2 with ghost re-triggers
3. **ZENOLOGY MELODY** (track 18) — 14-note dreamy pluck motif, Ab→Bb→C movement
4. **XV-5080 PAD** (track 13) — 16-note wide chord voicings, one per bar
5. **ZENOLOGY COUNTER** (track 20) — 8-note subtle F5/Eb5 fills

**What worked:**
- kbot AbletonOSC tools: transport, track rename, clip create, MIDI write, clip fire, mixer — all solid
- Plugin loading via AppleScript: `View > Search in Browser` → type name → keyboard Down arrows → Return
- ZENOLOGY (not FX) loads with 3 Down arrows to skip past FX presets
- TR-808 loaded via Python Quartz drag from browser to session view
- `cliclick` installed via Homebrew for macOS mouse automation

**What didn't work:**
- `load_plugin` OSC endpoint — always times out (custom kbot extension, not in standard AbletonOSC)
- CGEvent mouse drags — coordinates didn't match screen positions (Retina scaling mismatch)
- IDE terminal steals focus from Ableton on every bash command — solved by running clicks inside `osascript` blocks
- Loading multiple heavy Roland plugins in sequence can crash Ableton

**Presets still needed (user will do manually):**
- ZENOLOGY tracks need bass/pluck/texture presets selected
- XV-5080 needs a pad preset selected
- Add reverb + delay sends on melody and counter tracks

## Previous Session (2026-03-31 afternoon) — SHIP v3.59.0 + COMPUTER-USE VERIFIED

### Shipped to GitHub, npm pending auth

#### Published to GitHub
- **v3.59.0 committed and pushed** (96 files, +8,157 lines)
- Commit: `ea31a96b` + `1733988a` (serum2 registration fix)

#### What shipped
1. **5 bug fixes** — concurrent session state (memory.ts → Map), selfTrain guard, DNS rebinding SSRF, Gemini/Cohere tool warning, edit_file full-context diff
2. **Session isolation** — serve.ts creates unique session per HTTP request, destroys after
3. **9 M4L devices** — auto-pilot, bass-synth, dj-fx, drum-synth, genre-morph, hat-machine, pad-synth, riser-engine, sidechain
4. **DJ Set Builder** — registered in tool index
5. **Serum 2 Preset tool** — was missing from index, now registered
6. **Computer-use expansion** — 866+ lines added to computer.ts
7. **Ableton Live integration** — OSC-based class in integrations/

#### Computer-Use MCP Verified
- `list_granted_applications` — works
- `request_access` — works (granted Finder)
- `screenshot` — works (captured desktop)
- Significance: kbot goes from terminal-only to full desktop agent

#### Stats
- 698 tests passing (vitest), 0 type errors
- 670+ registered tools
- npm publish blocked — token expired, needs `npm login`

### Not done
- npm publish (needs auth)
- GitHub release (can do next session)
- Show HN post
- Video demo

## Previous Session (2026-03-31 night) — CODE QUALITY & CONCURRENCY FIXES

### Night shift — 5 bug fixes, 1 security fix, 8 new tests

#### Bug Fixes Applied
1. **Concurrent state in memory.ts** — Replaced single `sessionHistory` array with `Map<string, ConversationTurn[]>` keyed by session ID. All functions accept optional `sessionId` param (default `'default'`). Added `destroySession()` for serve mode cleanup. CLI unchanged.
2. **Concurrent state in learning.ts** — Added concurrency docs (shared state is intentional for learning). Added `selfTrainRunning` guard to prevent overlapping `selfTrain()` runs.
3. **DNS rebinding in fetch.ts** — SSRF protection now resolves hostname via `dns.lookup()` and checks resolved IP against blocked ranges. Domains pointing to 127.0.0.1 are now caught.
4. **Gemini/Cohere silent degradation** — Added upfront warning when these providers are used with tools: "provider doesn't support native tool calling — tools will be parsed from text output".
5. **edit_file diff preview** — Now passes full file content to diff preview (was passing just the matched fragment). Diff algorithm shows 3 lines of context with `...` separators.

#### Serve Mode Session Isolation (bonus)
- Wired `sessionId` through `AgentOptions` → `runAgent` → all memory calls
- `serve.ts` now creates a unique session per HTTP request and destroys it after
- Concurrent `/stream` requests no longer share conversation history

#### Tests
- 8 new session isolation tests in memory.test.ts
- **698 tests passing** (up from 690)
- 0 type errors (tsc --noEmit clean)
- Clean build

#### Stats
- 600 registered tools (verified: 549 in tools/ + 51 elsewhere)
- README "600+" claim is accurate
